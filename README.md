# NorpBot
This is a very simple Discord bot, I made really just to make a bot.
I plan to add eventually more features, like modding capabilities. But I don't have an ETA on that.

# Installing and running
You'll need a discord bot already created and added to a server.

Clone the project anywhere.
change into the directory and run ```npm install```
Then you'll need to create a .env file. And add
```
BOT_TOKEN="Your Token Here"
```
Then run ```node app.js``` to start the bot.
